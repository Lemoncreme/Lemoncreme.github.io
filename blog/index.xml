I am currently using them in Tiletest for collision detection and monster behavior. Quadtrees partition 2D space into quadrants (stored as nodes in a tree), dividing these quadrants into smaller quadrants when they contain more than a certain threshold of elements (shown as dots):
There are a couple uses for this structure, one of the most useful is searching for the nearest element to a given location.</description></item><item><title>Cellular Automata in WebGL: Part 1</title><link>https://benpm.github.io/blog/gol_1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jul 2020 10:08:45 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://benpm.github.io/blog/gol_1/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always been fascinated with cellular automata, like Conway&amp;rsquo;s Game of Life:
The idea that simple rules can produce structured, complex systems is beautiful to me. Of course I&amp;rsquo;m not the only one, Stephen Wolfram really has a thing for em&amp;rsquo; .
Anyways, I wanted a fun way to create and tweak cellular automata rules, so I decided to write a generalized cellular automaton simulator in WebGL . This post is about how it is implemented and what new interesting possibilities await!</description></item><item><title>Rectangle (AABB) Collisions</title><link>https://benpm.github.io/blog/2d-top-down-collisions-with-rectangles-aabbs/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jul 2020 22:10:40 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://benpm.github.io/blog/2d-top-down-collisions-with-rectangles-aabbs/</guid><description>Axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs) are very useful for doing simple collision detection and 2D physics. The basic idea is: loop through the boxes, checking for intersections with each other box. Then, you resolve these intersections by moving the boxes in the direction of the shortest intersection axis. So if the width of the intersection is smaller than its height, like it is here, then the boxes are moved on the x axis:</description></item><item><title>Hello World!</title><link>https://benpm.github.io/blog/hello_world/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jul 2020 15:57:51 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://benpm.github.io/blog/hello_world/</guid><description>This site is created with Hugo and the theme is based off Codex .
