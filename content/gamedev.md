I like to make games! I don't finish them very often, but that doesn't really matter, right?
Here are some of the notable ones I've made:

## Tiletest
This my current major project! It doesn't have a proper name yet, but it's supposed to be an
adventure RPG with someroguelike elements. The game worlds are procedurally generated, so you'll
never get the same experience twice! It also has multiplayer support.
You can keep up on it's development [here](/tags/tiletest/).

## [Npigs](https://ben-m.itch.io/npigs)
Npigs was a game I made for Ludum Dare 40 (*theme: "The more you have, the worse it is"*). It's a fairly challenging platformer with some funky clone mechanics. Your score depends on how many clones you have and how high you've climbed. There's a (probably) functioning scoreboard of top scores. The current high score is very high, so good luck beating it!

## [Rundash](https://gamejolt.com/games/rundash/511953)
Rundash is a simple multiplayer platformer where you race other players across randomly constructed levels.

## [Deep Cuts](https://gamejolt.com/games/deep-cuts/146526)
An dark, atmospheric puzzle game made for GameJolt Adventure Jam 2016. It won a judge's pick!

## [Paperlike](https://github.com/benpm/paperlike)
A simple web roguelike, originally intended to be run on the kindle paperwhite's "experimental" browser.

## [Erth](https://ben-m.itch.io/erth)
This is a pretty old one. It's a top-down RPG with crafting and building elements. It's kind of a disaster,
unbalanced and unpolished, but, hey, I made it in highschool.
