# Paperlike
Paperlike is a small, unfinished minimalistic roguelike written in Javascript.
My original inspiration for it was the Kindle Paperwhite experimental browser,
which can run some very basic Javascript applications.

You can play an unfinished version of the game [here](../paperlike).
The source code is also available [here](https://github.com/benpm/paperlike).
